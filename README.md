## Setup Instructions

### Development Server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Unit Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker images: `docker-compose build`
2. Run the Docker containers: `docker-compose up`
